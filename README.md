## Overview

The project utilizes a CNN architecture to classify X-ray images into COVID-19 positive or negative cases. It's designed to assist in automated diagnosis based on chest X-ray scans.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

1. Ensure the dataset is structured as per the README for the project.
2. Run the notebook or execute the script `covid_detection.py` to train the model.

## File Structure

The project contains:

- `Dataset`: Train and Val folders with COVID and Normal subfolders for training and validation data.
- `covid_detection.py`: Python script for model training.
- `README.md`: Details about the project.

## Model Architecture

The architecture of the model is depicted in below image.

## Results

Showcase model performance metrics or sample predictions with visualizations if available.
